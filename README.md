# cso2-master-server

This repository includes all the services required to run a game server for Counter-Strike: Online 2.

You can get [this client launcher](https://github.com/L-Leite/cso2-launcher) to play in the server.

A [test game server](https://cso2.leite.xyz) is available at the IP address `51.68.197.15` .

## Running the game server

### With Docker and `docker-compose`

You must have installed both [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/) and [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for these steps.

The repository has two `docker-compose` configuration files:

-   `docker-compose.development.yml` can be used for development environments
-   `docker-compose.production.yml` can be used for development production environments (such as a remote server).

#### Example start command

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up -d --build
```

#### Example stop command

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml down
```

### With Gulp

These steps require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to be installed in your system.

#### Setting up

In a shell, run

```sh
./config/init_db.sh # initializes the database user and tables
yarn # installs gulp and other build dependencies
npx gulp build # builds the game server components
```

#### Starting the server

In a shell, run

```sh
npx gulp start --intf eth0 # replace 'eth0' with your network interface
```

You can stop the server by pressing CTRL+C in the terminal.
